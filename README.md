# Highly available self-hosted gitlab runner

This repository contains the code to running a highly available self-hosted gitlab runner in the AWS cloud, using ansible, packer and terraform to provide all infrastructure.

I write this code to have as reference for my blog post, where I share how we can create the infra to run the gitlab runner, this two following posts, [part 1](http://felipefrizzo.github.io/post/self-hosted-gitlab-runner-with-iac-part-1/) and [part 2](http://felipefrizzo.github.io/post/self-hosted-gitlab-runner-with-iac-part-2/). The blog post is writing in Portuguese my native language, but I'm looking for translating to English.
